 Personal Journal Manager (Python)

A simple **command-line Personal Journal Manager** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
This program allows users to **add**, **view**, **search**, and **delete** personal journal entries, with each entry automatically timestamped.


 Features

 Add New Entries
- Write journal entries that are saved in a text file.
- Automatically records the **date and time** of each entry.

 View All Entries
- Displays all saved journal entries along with their timestamps.

 Search Entries
- Search for specific keywords within your journal entries.

 Delete All Entries
- Clears all stored entries from the journal file.

 Error Handling
- Handles file-related and input errors gracefully.



 How It Works

All operations are encapsulated inside the `JournalManager` class which handles:
- **File Handling** (reading, writing, deleting data)
- **Exception Handling**
- **Data Management** (timestamping, searching, formatting output)
